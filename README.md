# IPL-Win-Predictor
For creating an IPL-Win-Predictor in a Python project, the following libraries are essential:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, crucial for handling and preprocessing the IPL match data.

    Install with: pip install pandas
    NumPy: For numerical operations, often used alongside Pandas for efficient data processing.

    Install with: pip install numpy
    Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models. This library provides various algorithms for training models, preprocessing data, and evaluating model performance.

    Install with: pip install scikit-learn
    Joblib or Pickle: For saving and loading machine learning models. These libraries allow you to persist a trained model to disk and load it back for predictions.

    Install with: pip install joblib (Joblib is preferred for efficiency, especially with large models)
These libraries cover the fundamental aspects of data handling, model training, and persistence, forming the backbone of the IPL-Win-Predictor project in Python.
     
# Streamlit
For creating an IPL-Win-Predictor in a Streamlit application, you will need the following libraries:

Streamlit: The core library for building and running the interactive web application. Streamlit allows you to create web apps for machine learning and data science projects with minimal   effort.

    Install with: pip install streamlit
